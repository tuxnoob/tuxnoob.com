**Why i did Update Telegram Using Command Line???**

* And open terminal(Gnome-based) or konsole (KDE), now type command into directory telegram (default directory /opt/telegram). _note: you must quit telegram in system tray_
* Type command with root "Telegram update", wait until launch telegram interface. Press check for update and wait until completed, like this screenshot;
