#### What Is SimpeScreenRecorder???

**SimpleScreenRecorder** is a Linux program for desktop recording.  

This simplescreenrecorder functions the same as recordmydesktop, i think.  

#### Features :

* Graphical user interface (Qt-based).  
* Faster than VLC and ffmpeg/avconv.
* Records the entire screen or part of it, or records OpenGL applications directly (similar to Fraps on Windows).
* Synchronizes audio and video properly (a common issue with VLC and ffmpeg/avconv).
* Reduces the video frame rate if your computer is too slow (rather than using up all your RAM like VLC does).
* Fully multithreaded: small delays in any of the components will never block the other components, resulting is smoother video and better performance on computers with multiple processors.
* Pause and resume recording at any time (either by clicking a button or by pressing a hotkey).
* Shows statistics during recording (file size, bit rate, total recording time, actual frame rate, ...).
* Can show a preview during recording, so you don't waste time recording something only to figure out afterwards that some setting was wrong.
* Uses libav/ffmpeg libraries for encoding, so it supports many different codecs and file formats (adding more is trivial).
* Can also do live streaming (experimental).
* Sensible default settings: no need to change anything if you don't want to.
* Tooltips for almost everything: no need to read the documentation to find out what something does.
