This problem just a little problem, because the KDE default screenshot application is ksnapshot. But if you installing KDE Plasma ksnapshot was removed, and changing to spectacle.  

Yep like this name, i think spectacle very much of feature. Like second timing for take a screenshot, rectangular, active window, current window, window under cursor and full screen monitor.

### For spectacle work as screenshot

That spectacle to work, first go to **system settings** like a screenshot:

Yep in system settings, choose **Shorcut** then select **custom shortcut** scroll down until you find screenshot name like this:
