Maybe his friends already know tools for penetration, or may already know backtrack OS / Backtrack Reborn [Kali Linux]?  


Well inside the OS backtrack all the tools for penetration and security in this OS, but his friends also never felt the need to worry if you are not using the OS. For example OS that you are using Windows, you can only complement these tools into your OS, but may have to require large disk resource.  

Yes especially adjusted to the habits of you, if his friends are already accustomed to using windows yes go ahead.  

But here I would be giving out tutorial how to install the tool into my Arch Linux OS.  

Anyone know about Arch Linux? Sure lovers OS Linux already know about this one.  
If not know you can visit this [site](https://www.archlinux.org/)  

Here I use the repository blackarch, because repo this one provides a variety of tools for penetration, although not completely backtrack / Kali linux and linux other pentest.Okay, enough a intermezzo and following step by step:  

* First insert blackarch repository to pacman.conf :
