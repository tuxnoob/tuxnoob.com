Uniscan is a simple Remote File Include (RFI), Local File Include (LFI) and remote command vulnerability scanner such as RCE (Remote Code Execution), XSS (Cross-site scripting) and SQL injection.  

Uniscan is a tool CLI (Command Line Interface) or text-based and can running with GUI (Graphical User Interface). But the same uniscan, for performance still same. You can use either interface, but i prefer using uniscan with CLI.
