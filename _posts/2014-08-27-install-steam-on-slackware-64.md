After I read the post article [MR.Alien](http://alien.slackbook.org) :), I was interested in making a post on my blog. :)
but I see that it's only for the 32-bit Slackware version, but if you look at it in more detail, it turns out that it can also be installed on 64-bit Slackware :)
The first step you have to install is:

* First you first install the multilib(compat-32) so that it is compatible when we are going to install 32 bit software
* After that you first install the 32-bit version of OpenAL on your 64-bit machine
* then you install the 32 bit version of flash player plugins on your 64 bit Slackware machine
* Have Fun, Arief :)

  
To install the software above, please click this link
**[OpenAL](http://www.slackware.com/~alien/slackbuilds/OpenAL/pkg/)**
**[flashplayer-plugin](http://www.slackware.com/~alien/slackbuilds/flashplayer-plugin/pkg/)**
**[Multilib](http://www.slackware.com/~alien/multilib/)**
Well there you can find according to your version of Slackware
Thanks ;)
