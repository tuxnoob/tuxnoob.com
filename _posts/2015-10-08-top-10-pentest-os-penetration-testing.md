Kali Linux is penetration OS based from DEBIAN Linux, which addressed for Penetration Testing by IT security. Kali Linux not only use for penetration testing but kali linux can for auditing and i think can forensic too. Many tools included of Kali Linux, therefore many users who wear it. If you want use and wear you can [download this OS](https://www.kali.org/downloads/).  
My experience using this OS very stable, faster and can running on 2 Gb of RAM.

Bugtraq-Team was founded in 2011 by christian and ruben and was consolidated in 2012, has since evolved exponentially and today we still hunger for exploring new frontiers. We are an innovative group with different qualifications and knowledge of computer security... Since our inception our group lived and learned with other known hacking groups at international level. We also have years of experience working in security consulting, Unix systems administration, gesture of incidents, technical service, and social networking sites. If something we can point our group is that to date each specializes in their field and work to try to find new bugs, and current ways that are used by cyber-terrorists to undermine the systems of your company. _quoted from bugtraq-team_

Pentoo is a security - focused livecd based on gentoo.

It's basically a gentoo install with lots of customized tools, customized kernel, and much more.

  

Put simply, Pentoo is Gentoo with the pentoo overlay. This overlay is available in layman so all you have to do is layman -L and layman -a pentoo.

  

So if you once install gentoo, will be easy to understand and installing.

Like Pentoo, Tails. NodeZero is an Ubuntu based. NodeZero intended for penetration testing and security auditing.

  

NodeZero also live-system only, and can run from Usb, Dvd or virtual machine.

The Samurai Web Testing Framework is a live linux environment that has been pre-configured to function as a web pen-testing environment. The CD contains the best of the open source and free tools that focus on testing and attacking websites. In developing this environment, we have based our tool selection on the tools we use in our security practice. We have included the tools used in all four steps of a web pen-test.

  

Starting with reconnaissance, we have included tools such as the Fierce domain scanner and Maltego. For mapping, we have included tools such WebScarab and ratproxy. We then chose tools for discovery. These would include w3af and burp. For exploitation, the final stage, we included BeEF, AJAXShell and much more. This CD also includes a pre-configured wiki, set up to be the central information store during your pen-test.
