Yesterday i installing again **mate desktop** as mainly activity. When i installed mate, i had thought for disable the **minimize effect** in mate. Because mate desktop using **marco** and the **effect is ugly**, i trying to find cause these effects and voila i can **disable** **minimize effect in MATE.**  

To disable this effect, you just open **dconf-editor** [ in slackware linux has already included ].

After opened, now navigate to **->** **org** and select to **MATE**

And select to **desktop -> interface**, then **uncheck enable-animation** like this:

So you don't need **installing compiz** or **compton** as alternative **effect** and feel the **lightweight** in mate dekstop.  

Thanks, Arief!!!
